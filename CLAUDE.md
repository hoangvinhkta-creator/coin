# CLAUDE.md — Project Governance Entry Point

## Compact Directory Layout

This package stores static governance under `governance/` to keep repository root thin.

- `CLAUDE.md` = governance entry point at root.
- `PROJECT/` = current project state.
- `docs/` = runtime tasks, sessions, reviews, ADRs.
- `governance/` = static rules, templates, validators, references.

Do not move governance files back to root.
The mandatory read order and all original governance mechanisms remain unchanged; only canonical paths differ.


## Core Principle
Do not code first and organize later.

The repository is the shared memory:
- Rules → governance files
- Current state → `PROJECT/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md`
- Non-technical progress view → `PROJECT/LO_TRINH_DE_HIEU.md` (generated automatically from PROJECT_PROGRESS)
- Project profile → `PROJECT/PROJECT_PROFILE.md`
- Tactical decisions → `PROJECT/PROJECT_DECISIONS.md`
- Architecture decisions → `docs/adr/`
- Task definitions → `docs/tasks/`
- Session history/handoffs → `docs/sessions/`
- Reusable forms → `templates/`

## S000 — First Actions

S000 has ONE canonical procedure.

1. Read `governance/core/PROJECT_PROFILE_STANDARD.md`.
2. Read `governance/core/RULE_PRECEDENCE.md`.
3. Read `governance/core/TASK_MODE_STANDARD.md`.
4. Then execute the full ordered S000 procedure in `governance/core/00_SESSION_ORCHESTRATION.md`.

Do not maintain a second S000 checklist in this file.

## Project Profiles

Use `governance/core/PROJECT_PROFILE_STANDARD.md`.

Profiles:
- SOLO_LITE
- PRODUCT
- TEAM_PRODUCTION
- AUDIT

Profile selection determines governance depth; it does not dictate a specific technical stack.

## Rule Conflicts

Use `governance/core/RULE_PRECEDENCE.md`.

Do not resolve material rule conflicts silently.

## Every Implementation Session

1. Read `PROJECT/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md`.
2. Read `PROJECT/PROJECT_PROFILE.md`.
3. Identify current task and Task Mode.
4. For MAJOR tasks, read the task file under `docs/tasks/`.
5. Verify the appropriate Ready Gate.
6. Load Scope Lock.
7. Load the finalized/frozen Completion Gate.
8. Read relevant governance files.
9. For MAJOR work, calculate Primary Tier + Effort from canonical 0–4 routing metadata using `AGENT_CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md` / `routing_engine.py`; never choose them by intuition or infer Effort from Tier. Apply hard floors inside the routing calculation and require `validate_routing.py` to PASS before execution.
10. Begin implementation only when READY.

## Task Modes

Use `governance/core/TASK_MODE_STANDARD.md`.

- MICRO — low-risk bounded work with compact checklist.
- MAJOR — full task file + dedicated session + gates + handoff.
- SPIKE / EXPLORATORY — reduces uncertainty before implementation.

## Task Lifecycle

NOT_PLANNED
→ PLANNED
→ READY
→ IN_PROGRESS
→ IMPLEMENTED
→ VERIFYING
→ DONE

Alternative states:
BLOCKED / DEFERRED / CANCELLED

## Evidence

Use `governance/core/EVIDENCE_STANDARD.md`.

Never invent evidence.

For executable checks:
- Risk 3 → E1 required for REQUIRED checks.
- Risk 4–5 → E1 required; security/data-critical checks should seek E2.

If not executed:
Status = NOT_TESTED.

## Completion

Use `governance/core/TASK_COMPLETION_GATE_STANDARD.md`.

CODE COMPLETE ≠ TASK COMPLETE.

A task is DONE only when:
- all REQUIRED checks PASS,
- required evidence levels are satisfied,
- Exit Criteria are satisfied.

## Integration

Use `governance/core/PHASE_RELEASE_GATE_STANDARD.md`.

Task DONE ≠ Phase DONE.
Phase DONE ≠ Release Ready.

## Escalation

Use `governance/core/ESCALATION_PROTOCOL.md`.

Do not repeatedly patch a failing implementation.

## Progress Questions

If the user asks:
- current progress,
- current step,
- remaining work,
- next step,
- checklist,

READ `PROJECT/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` FIRST.

Do not answer from conversational memory.

## Scope Expansion

Do not silently edit outside a task's Scope Lock.

If required:

SCOPE EXPANSION REQUIRED

Then reassess impact before continuing.

## Conflict Rule

If documentation, implementation, data, security, or current behavior conflict:

CONFLICT DETECTED

Documentation:
...

Implementation:
...

Risk:
...

Recommended resolution:
...

Do not guess silently.

## Language Rule

All user-facing responses produced during every session must be written in Vietnamese.
All files whose purpose is to explain, summarize, report, or update project progress, session progress, current status, completed work, remaining work, next steps, handoffs, or other human-readable progress information must be written in Vietnamese.
Technical tokens that must remain unchanged for system correctness — including code, terminal commands, variable names, enums, identifiers, file paths, filenames, schema values, and IDs such as `READY`, `DONE`, `MAJOR`, `S000`, `S001`, and `S002` — must remain unchanged when translation could affect system behavior.

## Final Rule

The agent must prove completion through artifacts and evidence, not through narrative confidence.

## Roadmap Synchronization

`PROJECT/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` is the only roadmap source of truth. `PROJECT/LO_TRINH_DE_HIEU.md` is generated automatically. For MAJOR tasks, Tier/Effort displayed in the roadmap MUST come from validated routing metadata, not manual selection. After any roadmap/status/Tier/Effort/dependency change, follow `governance/core/ROADMAP_SYNC_STANDARD.md`; run routing validation before roadmap sync; never edit ticks in the generated file by hand.
